## Updates

- [05/2025] Initial release

## Introduction

 We  present SplitLoRA, a method for continual learning that combines orthogonal projection with LoRA. It improves the balance between plasticity and stability by effectively mitigating interference between new and old tasks. This repository provides the official implementation, train and evaluation scripts.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iLearn-Lab/ICLR26-SplitLoRA.git
cd ICLR26-SplitLoRA
```

### 2. Create environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux / Mac
# .venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Dataset preparation
#### Download the datasets and uncompress them:

- CIFAR-100: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
- ImageNet-R: https://github.com/hendrycks/imagenet-r
- DomainNet: https://ai.bu.edu/M3SDA/

#### Rearrange the directory structure:

Directory structure for three datasets:
```
DATA_ROOT
    |- train
    |    |- class_folder_1
    |    |    |- image_file_1
    |    |    |- image_file_2
    |    |- class_folder_2
    |         |- image_file_2
    |         |- image_file_3
    |- val
         |- class_folder_1
         |    |- image_file_5
         |    |- image_file_6
         |- class_folder_2
              |- image_file_7
              |- image_file_8
```
We provide the scripts `split_[dataset].py` in the `tools` folder to rearange the directory structure.
Please change the `root_dir` in each script to the path of the uncompressed dataset.

## Usage

For three datasets: `python reproduce.py`
